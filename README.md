These are all of my school exercises I can find. There will be more coming on and broadening this repository while the years pass. 
There are two files for each exercise. The code it self will be onto the C Source File. You can download it to see the developed code. 
Otherwise you can directly run the code within your terminal through the Unix Executable File.
